# Next.js Crypto Project
A modern cryptocurrency dashboard built with Next.js, providing users with features like real-time market analytics, user authentication, and portfolio management. The app uses MongoDB for data storage, Chart.js for visualizations, and NextAuth.js for authentication.


## APIs Used
1. CoinGecko API: For fetching real-time cryptocurrency data.
2. NextAuth.js: For user authentication and session management


## Features
1. Real-Time Cryptocurrency Analytics: Track top gainers, losers, and market trends with data from CoinGecko API.
2. User Authentication: Secure login and signup functionality using NextAuth.js with MongoDB.
3. Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices.
4. Protected Routes: Access control for authenticated users.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
